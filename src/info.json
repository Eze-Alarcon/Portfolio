I focus on writing HTML as semantic as possible, using CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mainly use React, but I can adapt to any tool required. Right now I'm based in Madrid, Spain, but I come from a small town in Córdoba, Argentina. When I'm not coding, you'll find me learning some new technology, looking for ways to improve the ones I know, but I also enjoy exploring new places, either inside or outside the city. My future plans involve learning more about front-end development and learning about back-end so I can create more complex solutions when needed.",

Me enfoco en escribir HTML lo más semántico posible, usando prácticas de CSS y escribiendo JavaScript limpio. Cuando escribo código JavaScript, principalmente utilizo React, pero puedo adaptarme a cualquier herramienta que se requiera. Ahora mismo estoy radicado en Madrid, España, pero provengo de una pequeña ciudad en Córdoba, Argentina. Cuando no estoy codificando, me encontraras aprendiendo alguna nueva tecnología, buscando maneras de mejorar aquellas que conozco, pero también disfruto de explorar lugares nuevos, ya sean dentro o fuera de la ciudad.Mis planes a futuro involucran conocer más del desarrollo front-end y aprender sobre back-end para poder crear soluciones más complejas cuando sean necesarias.",
