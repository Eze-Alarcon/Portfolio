### What I learned


To be honest, this was not the first version. This project started as semantic HTML and modern CSS but because I wanted to implement a way to have different languages and be able to quickly change projects, so I decided to implement React.js (a technology I was learning). 

OK, that said, I was faced with several challenges when it came to making what was supposed to be "a simple portfolio". Starting from "what project to show", to "how to implement a form" (I mean a form that really works and is not just visual, if you send a message through the form I will really receive an email) and also how to deal with different languages for the same page without the user having to reload all the pages.

At the time of making this portfolio, I had a full time job in an alarm monitoring center, with rotating shifts, so it was a complex task. It was a bit frustrating to have great ideas at work and have to wait until the end of the shift to go home and implement my idea (if I even remembered it) but with effort and dedication it worked out pretty well. 

I doubt anyone will read this but even though it sounds like it was a difficult task I want to say that it was rather fun and I quite enjoyed this challenge. 

After overcoming these challenges and having my portfolio live I can say with full confidence that I love web development.

### Useful resources

- [Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This pages help me a lot back in the days and i still use it time to time, it has a lot of information in a very practical and visual way.
